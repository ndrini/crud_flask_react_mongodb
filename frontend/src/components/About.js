        <p>Cuomo Must Admit to His ‘Predatory Behavior,’ Accuser Says
        “These are not the actions of someone who simply feels misunderstood; they are the actions of an individual who wields his power to avoid justice,” Charlotte Bennett said.

        ALBANY, N.Y. — A former aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo who has accused the governor of sexual harassment said on Monday that the governor “has refused to acknowledge or take responsibility for his predatory behavior” and encouraged other women with similar experiences to step forward.

        The aide, Charlotte Bennett, said in a statement on Monday that Mr. Cuomo’s response to her claims, and that of another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, indicated that he did not actually want the truth of his actions to be reported.

        “As we know, abusers — particularly those with tremendous amounts of power — are often repeat offenders who engage in manipulative tactics to diminish allegations, blame victims, deny wrongdoing and escape consequences,” Ms. Bennett said. “It took the governor 24 hours and significant backlash to allow for a truly independent investigation. These are not the actions of someone who simply feels misunderstood; they are the actions of an individual who wields his power to avoid justice.”

        Ms. Bennett’s statement — her first public comments since her allegations were published by The New York Times on Saturday — comes as Mr. Cuomo’s administration continues to deal with the fallout of a scandal that has left the three-term Democratic incumbent in precarious political straits.
